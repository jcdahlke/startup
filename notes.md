From the GitHub assignment I have learned how to create markdown files, use VS Code with Github, and just how to use Github in general
[Back to README](README.md)

These are Notes from the CS 260 Class and these can even be used in the midterm and final

## HTML
### HTML Overview:
HTML structures web content and is foundational for web development.
Core to both Single Page Applications (SPAs) and Multi-Page Applications (MPAs).
### Basic Example:
Simple HTML document structure:
html
'&lt;p>Hello world&lt;/p>'

### Elements & Tags:
Tags are enclosed with &lt; > and define content structure, e.g.,
'&lt;p>text&lt;/p>' for paragraphs.
### Attributes:
Elements can have attributes like id and class, e.g.,'&lt;p id="greet" class="welcome">'.

### Hyperlinks:
Links are created with the
'&lt;a> tag, e.g., &lt;a href="url">link text&lt;/a>'.
### Common HTML Elements:
html, head, body, p, h1-h9, a, div, img, form.

## HTML Startup
