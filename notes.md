[Back to README](README.md)

These are Notes from the CS 260 Class and these can even be used in the midterm and final

## AWS
➜  ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]
For example,

➜  ssh -i ~/keys/production.pem ubuntu@53.104.2.123
My public IP address: http://34.239.126.78/
Size: t2.micro
Server Region: US East (N. Virginia) - us-east-1
