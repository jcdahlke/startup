# Color Guesser
Did you know that there are over 16 million different color combinations using just red, green, and blue?! Some of these combinations are so close it can get very hard for the human eye to spot the difference, and that is what this game is testing! Multiple frames will be shown of different colors, and the color combination of the one you are looking for will be at the top. It is your job to determine which colored frame matches the color combination listed. If you are correct you get a point, but if you fail your game starts over. The people with the highest scores will be displayed on the leaderboard.
