        <h2>What is RGB?</h2>
        <img src="https://media.istockphoto.com/id/469119596/vector/isolated-circular-rainbow-gradient.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=Ewqrbzc1Hicb_IOsjdxk7-kFPxEq3BfAxDTJUk4AGMA=" alt="RGB Color Wheel" width = 150>
        <p>RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue, which are the three primary colors of light used in digital displays like computer monitors, TVs, and phone screens. By mixing different intensities of these three colors, we can create a wide range of other colors.<br>
            <br>
            Hereâ€™s how it works:<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Red, Green, and Blue are the base colors.</li>
                <li>Each color can have a value between 0 (no intensity) and 255 (full intensity).</li>
                <li>When you combine different values of these three colors, you get different colors. For example</li>
                <li>Full red (255, 0, 0) gives you red.</li>
                <li>Full green (0, 255, 0) gives you green.</li>
                <li>Full blue (0, 0, 255) gives you blue.</li>
                <li>Combining red, green, and blue at full intensity (255, 255, 255) gives you white.</li>
                <li>No light at all (0, 0, 0) results in black.</li>
                <li>This system is the foundation for most of the colors you see on digital screens!</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Play</h2>
            <p>You will be presented with a random color value (ex. (213, 198, 002) 213 is the Red Intensity, 198 is the green intensity, 002 is the blue intensity)
                <br>You're job is to figure out what color that makes. You will be presented with 6 displays of colors. 5 of them have been randomly generated
                <br> while the 6th one actually shows the color display that corresponds to the vaule that was given. So must select the color you think is the
                <br>perfect match and hit submit. If you are correct you get a point, if not you lose all your points. Compete against family and friends to see
                <br>who knows their colors the best! Click play at the top to start!
